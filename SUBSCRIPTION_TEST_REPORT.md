## Detailed Findings

### Strengths

1. **Clean Product Structure**
   - Three well-defined paid tiers (Startup, Growth, Enterprise)
   - Clear free tier (Solo) with 1 canary
   - All products active and properly configured in Stripe

2. **Consistent Pricing**
   - 16.7% discount for annual billing across all tiers
   - Logical price progression matching value (canary limits)
   - All prices in USD currency

3. **Complete Configuration**
   - All environment variables properly set
   - Both monthly and annual prices for each tier
   - Each tier uses a single Stripe product with two price variations

4. **Proper Product Mapping**
   - Monthly and annual prices correctly use the same product
   - Enables seamless billing frequency changes
   - No orphaned or misconfigured prices

### Warnings

1. **Old Inactive Products** ⚠️
   - **Product**: `prod_T2ly1pEt5GqdP8` (Old SilentCanary Growth)
   - **Status**: INACTIVE

   ```

   - Track successful billing frequency changes
   - Verify upgrade/downgrade flows in production
